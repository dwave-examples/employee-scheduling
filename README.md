# Employee Scheduling

Employee scheduling is a common industry problem that often becomes complex
due to real-world constraints. This example demonstrates
a scheduling scenario with a variety of employees and rules.

## Installation

You can run this example without installation in cloud-based IDEs that support 
the [Development Containers specification](https://containers.dev/supporting)
(aka "devcontainers").

For development environments that do not support ``devcontainers``, install 
requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are cloning the repo to your local system, working in a 
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is 
recommended.

## Usage

Your development environment should be configured to 
[access Leapâ€™s Solvers](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/overview/sapi.html).
You can see information about supported IDEs and authorizing access to your 
Leap account [here](https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/doc_leap_dev_env.html).  

To run the demo, type the ``python app.py`` command into your terminal and then open a web browser
to the URL printed to the terminal.

Set any of the input options to configure the problem and then click the "Solve CQM"
button. While the problem is being solved, you can see status updates in the browser and terminal.

### Introducing the Demo

The employee availability chart shows employee shift preferences and unavailable
days (PTO). Preferred shifts are in teal and marked with a 'P', while
unavailable shifts are in orange and marked with an 'X'.

In the chart, there are three different types of employees.

- Managers: These are employees with 'Mgr' at the end of their name.
- Employees: These are employees with no tag at the end of their name.
- Trainees: These are employees with 'Tr' at the end of their name. The trainee
  has the same name as their trainer. The trainee can **only** be scheduled to
  work on a shift that their trainer is also scheduled to work.

The chart displays employee preferences and availability for this month. It will
always display the current month, with one column for each day in this current
month.

### Inputs

Input options under the Basic Configuration tab are as follows:

- Number of employees: Schedules always include 2 managers  and 1 trainee.
- Example scenario: Auto-populates all settings with scenarios of varying
  sizes that produce feasible solutions.

Additional input options under the Advanced Configuration tab are as follows:

- Allow isolated days off: Unchecked, this option means that employees are
  scheduled at least two consecutive days off between work days.
- Require a manager on every shift: Checked, this option means that every shift
  must have exactly one manager on duty to supervise.
- Min/max shifts per employee: The range you set determines the number of shifts an
  employee can work in the month.
- Min/max employees per shift: The range you set determines how many employees need
  to be assigned to each shift.
- Max consecutive shifts: The maximum number of consecutive shifts an employee
  can be scheduled before a day off must be scheduled.
- Random seed: Optional; use if you want consistency between subsequent runs of the example.

### Outputs

Once the problem has completed, the best solution returned is displayed in
place of "Employee Availability". Click back to "Employee Availability" using
the tabs at the top of the schedule card.

The solution returned is either the best feasible solution (if a feasible
solution is found) or the best infeasible solution (if no feasible solution is
found). If an infeasible solution is found, scrolling down shows the list of
constraints that were violated.

### STEPH NOTES: 
### Testing with API inputs

The file api_tests.py can be used to test the solution received from Dwave for a given 
employee list and shift template list. Please note that although an array of shift 
templates is accepted (for future API use), only the first will be used when running the cqm, 
until such a time it will be adapted to consider multiple shift templates.

In the run_cqm function, you can adjust the time limit to allow extra time for dwave computing to 
find an optimal solution. I set it to the minimum which is 5 seconds, purely to minimise consumption 
of the free dwave minutes.
